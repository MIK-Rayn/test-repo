      KPI: Fulfillment Success Rate
      
      This metric represents the proportion of orders that reach a 'Completed' fulfillment status. It is calculated by dividing the number of distinct orders with a fulfillment status of 'Completed' (from ORDER_HISTORY) by the total number of distinct order fulfillment instructions (from ORDERS_FULFILLMENT_START_INSTRUCTION).
    columns:
      - name: fulfillment_success_rate
        description: >
          The fulfillment success rate is determined as:
          (Count of distinct orders with ORDER_FULFILLMENT_STATUS = 'Completed') divided by (Count of distinct order ids in ORDERS_FULFILLMENT_START_INSTRUCTION).
