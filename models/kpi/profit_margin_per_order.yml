    description: >
      This model calculates the Profit Margin per Order KPI. It assesses the profitability of each order by subtracting all costs (including the cost of goods sold, shipping costs, and fees) from the total order value. The KPI is calculated using the formula:
      (order_history.total_value - (SUM(orders_line_item.cost_value * orders_line_item.quantity) + SUM(orders_line_item.shipping_cost_value) + order_history.fee_value)) / order_history.total_value.
